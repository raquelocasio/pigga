# pigga
A responsive theme built for restaurants. This theme is an adaption of the Pigga HTML website template at https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page277/pigga. Hope you like it!

You can view a live demo of this theme at https://raquelocasio.com/htmltowordpresstheme/

This theme uses custom fields and custom post types.

This project was inspired by Mr. Digital's Youtube tutorial on how to convert an HTML template to a WordPress theme: https://youtu.be/FN5jhyspVXc
